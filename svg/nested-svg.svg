<!-- Some points to consider when using nested SVGs:
• If you don’t include a viewBox, a default coordinate system is
created in which the length of the user units is the same as for
the parent SVG. However, the origin is reset to the top-left cor‐
ner of the nested SVG (defined by x and y) and percentages are
reset to use the nested SVG’s width and height.
• If the parent SVG used preserveAspectRatio= "none", the
vertical and horizontal units used to establish the new coordi‐
nate system may not be equal. The aspect ratio of the new coor‐
dinate system will be evaluated according to the length in parent
units, not according to the actual displayed aspect ratio.
In other words, it is impossible to “reset” aspect ratio control
once it has been turned off.
• By default, any content that extends outside the width and
height of the nested <svg> will be clipped. You can change this
behavior by setting the CSS overflow property (or presentation
attribute) to visible. -->
